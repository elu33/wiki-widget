# Wiki-widget
  This is a shiny desktop application that imitates a wikipedia search, via an API, in addition to optional webscraping for a more detailed content analysis
# Functionality
  The user inputs a search term. The search term is passed into a wikipedia API. A table of results relevant to the search term is returned to the user. Out of the relevant terms, the user can select a term and pass it back into the API for a summary of the term.  The application can also scrape the searchterms actual wikipedia webpage for important subtitle headings, as well as the full contents of the searchterms webpage.
