# Wiki-widget
This is a shiny desktop application that imitates a wikipedia search, via an API, supplemented by optional webscraping for a more detailed content analysis.
# Functionality
The user inputs a search-term, which is passed into a wikipedia API. A table of results relevant to the search-term is returned to the user. Out of the relevant terms, the user can select a term and pass it back into the API for a summary of the term.  
The application can also scrape the search-terms actual wikipedia webpage for important subtitle headings, as well as the full contents of the search-terms webpage.
